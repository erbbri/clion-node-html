<h2>Poems</h2>
<p>
    Woah, be thankful for rest<br>
    with his unrelenting invitation<br>
    <br>
    <span class="lavender">Woah, be thankful for the day<br>
        I finally acquiesce<br></span>
    <br>
    And when it happens<br>
    may the roots of a small plant<br>
    find me in the earth<br>
    <br>
    <span class="lavender"" >hold me in its sprawling embrace<br>
        say nothing of my name<br>
        and survive the winter<br></span>
    <br>

<h2>Lyrics</h2>
<p>
    Walk through the world with care, my love<br>
    And sing the things you see<br>
    Let new names take and root and thrive and grow<br>
    And even as you stumble through machair sands eroding<br>
    Let the fern unfurl your grieving, let the heron still your breathing<br>
    Let the selkie swim you deeper, oh my little silver-seeker<br>
    Even as the hour grows bleaker, be the singer and the speaker<br>
    And in city and in forest, let the larks become your chorus<br>
    And when every hope is gone, let the raven call you home<br>
</p>

<h2>Quotes</h2>
<p>
<q>For women, then, poetry is not a luxury. It is a vital necessity of our existence.
    It forms the quality of the light within which we predicate our hopes and dreams
    toward survival and change, first made into language, then into idea, then into more tangible action.
    Poetry is the way we help give name to the nameless so it can be thought.
    The farthest horizons of our hopes and fears are cobbled by our poems,
    carved from the rock experiences of our daily lives.</q>
